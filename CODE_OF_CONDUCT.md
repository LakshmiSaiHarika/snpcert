As contributors and maintainers of the projects under the [sev-certify](https://github.com/AMDEPYC/sev-certify.git) repository, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute.

We are committed to making participation in these projects a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery.
* Personal attacks.
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing their project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.
